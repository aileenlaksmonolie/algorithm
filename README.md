# Algorithm projects

Various algorithms are explored in these projects and a time complexity analysis is made to compare the performance of the algorithms.


## 1. Search algorithm on strings

In this project, we implemented various search algorithms to search a genome sequence (string) in a text file. 
(search algorithm explored are brute force search, reverse Boyer Moore algorithm, and Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm)

## 2. Search algorithm on graphs

In this project, we implemented various search algorithms to find the shortest path on an unweighted graph.
(search algorithm explored is Breadth-First Search (BFS))
